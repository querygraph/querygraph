  “The answer used OSI metric *X*, resolved to Sail table *Y*, under capability
  *C* and `odrl:read`, emitting OpenLineage run *R* anchored by attestation
  *A* — and source *Z* was denied, with a receipt.” The differentiator for
  enterprise AI is not a longer context window; it is this verifiable chain
  from question to answer. Denials are receipts, never errors.

#section[Goshawk and Sentinel: the interoperability releases]
*Real Ed25519 across languages* — Python signs, Rust verifies; Rust signs,
Python verifies; same seed ⇒ same `did:key`; tampering fails on either side.
*HTTP `/v1` API* with TypeDID envelope auth (path- and body-bound; 401s carry
receipts). *MCP servers in both languages* — Claude, LangChain, PydanticAI,
LlamaIndex, CrewAI connect with zero adapters. *A2A agent card* published
identically by both implementations. *Official OpenLineage conformance* —
events schema-validated, deterministic UUIDv5 run ids shared across languages.
Sentinel (0.4.0) adds the *governed navigator loop*: question → semantic search →
policy receipts → SQL plans over allowed sources only → any LLM (or the
deterministic baseline) → signed envelope + lineage + attestation.

#section[Held equivalent by tests]
An executable cross-language contract: byte-identical navigator bundles,
matching governance semantics in the multi-agent story, both crypto directions
verified live, both CLIs' lineage events schema-valid, identical agent cards,
and a live auth round-trip — 49 Python + 40 Rust tests, CI on every push.
